/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.main-content{
    height:75%;
    vertical-align:middle;
    text-align:center;
    color:#aaa;
}

.bottom-buttons {
   vertical-align:bottom;
}

.btn {
    font-size: 18;
    margin:0;
   
}

.btn-start {
    background-color:limegreen;    
}

.btn-stop {
    background-color:red;
}

.btn-resume {
    background-color:white;
    color:#444;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
